GETTING STARTED WITH MACHINE LEARNING IN PYTHON:
Machine learning is one of the hottest new technologies to emerge into popular consciousness in the last decade, transforming fields from consumer electronics and healthcare to retail. This has led to intense curiosity about this field among many students and working professionals about the field.

Simply put, machine learning is a set of statistical techniques and algorithms designed to find and use structure and patterns in data to make interesting predictions or provide cool insights. Organizations use machine learning for all kinds of applications: whether it’s translating text from one language to another, detecting obstacles in front of self-driving cars or for identifying fraudulent credit card transactions.

If you’re a tech professional such as a software developer, business analyst or even a product manager, you might be curious about how machine learning can change they way you work and take your career to the next level. However, as a busy professional, you’re also looking for a way to get a solid understanding of machine learning that’s not only rigorous and practical, but also concise and fast.
BASICS OF PYTHON:
It is a well-established fact that Python is one of the most popular programming languages in both the coding and Data Science communities. But have you ever wondered why Python is so popular? What is the secret behind Python’s worldwide success and fame?

What makes Python the “Best of the Best?
Here are some of the most noteworthy features of Python that make it an excellent tool for professionals of all skill levels:
   Python = Simplicity

What makes Python the best programming language for machine learning :
Python offers concise and readable code. While complex algorithms and versatile workflows stand behind machine learning and AI, Python’s simplicity allows developers to write reliable systems. Developers get to put all their effort into solving an ML problem instead of focusing on the technical nuances of the language.

Additionally, Python is appealing to many developers as it’s easy to learn. Python code is understandable by humans, which makes it easier to build models for machine learning.

What is the use of Python in machine learning?
Python, with its rich technology stack, has an extensive set of libraries for artificial intelligence and machine learning. Here are some of them: Keras, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn for machine learning. NumPy for high-performance scientific computing and data analysis.

What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is getting computers to program themselves. If programming is automation, then machine learning is automating the process of automation.

Machine Learning: Data and output is run on the computer to create a program. This program can be used in traditional programming.

Applications of Machine Learning:
1.Web search: ranking page based on what you are most likely to click on.
2.Computational biology: rational design drugs in the computer based on past experiments.
3.Finance: decide who to send what credit card offers to. Evaluation of risk on credit offers. How to decide where to invest money.
4.E-commerce:  Predicting customer churn. Whether or not a transaction is fraudulent.
6.Space exploration: space probes and radio astronomy.
7.Robotics: how to handle uncertainty in new environments. Autonomous. Self-driving car.
8.Information extraction: Ask questions over databases across the web.
9.Social networks: Data on relationships and preferences. Machine learning to extract value from data.
10.Debugging: Use in computer science problems like debugging. Labor intensive process. Could suggest where the bug could be.

Types of Learning:
Supervised learning: (also called inductive learning) Training data includes desired outputs.  This is spam this is not, learning is supervised.Supervised learning is one of the major categories of machine learning algorithms. In this form of learning, the data contains labeled examples of the concept you want the algorithm to learn. For example, if you want an algorithm to predict fraud, you’ll supply it with examples that denote fraud and examples that are non-fraud. The algorithm learns to distinguish the two categories. This kind of distinction between categories is called ‘classification’. Another kind of supervised learning is ‘regression’, where an algorithm learns to predict values on a continuous scale, for example, given data for past sales, can we predict future values of sales of a product? In this chapter, we cover some of the most important supervised
1.LINEAR PREDICTIONS
Linear methods are the simplest, yet often the fastest and most effective set of algorithms. They assume that the data can be represented by a (multidimensional) line. In the case of regression, the line represents the structure of the data. In the case of classification, the line represents the boundary between the different classes. In this section, we cover the basics of linear methods in general, and then show how to use them in Python.
2.NON-LINEAR PREDICTIONS
While linear methods work well enough a lot of the time, real-world problems are sometimes much more complex. Fortunately, we have at our disposal other machine learning algorithms and techniques to deal with complex, non-linear data sets. In this section, we’ll cover two of these 
Unsupervised learning: Training data does not include desired outputs. Example is clustering. It is hard to tell what is good learning and what is not.
In contrast to supervised learning, unsupervised learning does not need labeled data. The idea behind unsupervised learning is to discover structure in a new data set from scratch. This can be extremely useful, e.g. finding segments of customers for a consumer product

1.CLUSTERING:

Clustering is the most common use case for unsupervised learning. The problem of clustering is to find groups within a data set that have some commonalities. Clustering can be used for a variety of applications, from customer segmentation to basic recommendation systems.
